# for...um...
A small project to write code to run both the client-side and server-side operations for a basic forum that uses TCP-sockets.

## Who?
Me, Myself, and I

## What?
Code for a very basic TCP-based forum, with both server and client code, capable of holding and storing a large history of messages with information on who, what, and when, to reconstruct temporal excerpts from message history.

## When?
During my time as a Software Systems UTA (Undergraduate Teaching Assistant)

## Where?
The program - here, on GitHub :)\
The programmer - based in London\
The programming - my laptop, on VSCode

## Why?
In class we are taught to write a simple two-way chat between two clients, mediated by a server: it's not that extensive and should be relatively simplistic for the sake of example, but for my own interest I decided to extend it a bit and add some features that I thought would be fun.

## How?
> TODO: this should describe how to use this program (once I've written it :p)
